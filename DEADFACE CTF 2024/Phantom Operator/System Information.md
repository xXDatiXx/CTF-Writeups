# System Information
## Challenge
- Forensics
- DEADFACE CTF

### Description
>Note: Use the memory dump file from Right Time.
>
>The malware that was ran on Garryâ€™s machine gathered system information. We suspect that this information was saved on the system somewhere. Provide the full filepath to the file where DEADFACE saved system information.
>
>Submit the flag as flag{path\to\file}. Example: flag{C:\Windows\System32\file.txt}

### Objective
The objective was to find the full filepath to a document where DEADFACE saved system information.
## Analysis
Clone the repo `https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3`.

With the comand `python3 vol.py -f /physmem.raw windows.filescan` we can scan the memory dump file to find recently opened or closed files.
But since the output is too large I kept it in a txt to analyze later. This also benefits me in being able to search for information in the command output.
`python3 vol.py -f /physmem.raw windows.filescan > salid.txt`

In the description we can see that they use .txt. So I decided to search for .txt files:

## Theory
`windows.filescan` Scans for file objects present in a particular windows memory image.

## Solution
- Run `python3 vol.py -f /physmem.raw windows.filescan > salid.txt`
- Search for .txt files.
- `flag{C:\Windows\Temp\sysinfo.txt}`
