# CTF Writeups

Welcome to my repository of CTF writeups! ðŸš©

Here youâ€™ll find detailed solutions to the *Capture The Flag* (CTF) challenges Iâ€™ve solved. My goal is to document the resolution process, share strategies, and explain the approaches used for each challenge. This repository serves as both a personal learning archive and a resource for other cybersecurity enthusiasts looking to learn and improve.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Inside?

- **Challenge Categories**: Cryptography, Pwn, Forensics, Web, OSINT, and more.
- **Detailed Explanations**: Each writeup includes a problem description, analysis, tools used, and step-by-step solutions.
- **Code and Scripts**: Whenever applicable, I include scripts or code snippets used to solve the challenges.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repository has two main purposes:
1. **Learn and grow** in the world of CTFs and cybersecurity.
2. **Contribute to the community** by providing clear, well-documented solutions that can serve as references for others.

## ðŸš€ Contributions

If you have feedback, suggestions, or even alternative solutions, Iâ€™d love to hear from you! Feel free to open an *issue* or submit a *pull request*. Learning is a collaborative process. ðŸ’¡
